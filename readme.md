# Assignment 2

This repo contains the practical part for the second assignment of the Representation Learning class taught at Université de Montréal.

In `models.py`, we completed the code for the vanilla RNN, the GRU and the multi-head attention unit.

We used `ptb-lm.py` to run our experiments, as instructed by the assignment. In order to run miscellaneous task however, we created a `training.py` module that more or less copies the former, with slight changes.

Most of our experiments have been interpreted using a [notebook](notebooks/Assignment%202.ipynb), which may be useful.
